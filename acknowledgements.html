I learned so much here and I was suprised by how much I was treated as just another full time employee. You will be in awe because of how much responsibility and freedom is given to you. After the eight months I have most of the tools I need to make my very own web application. These two terms have been the most beneficial for my career.

              <p class="section-content">I want to let the entire team at Tulip Retail know how much I loved working there. They taught me a lot about the industry and technology. My team members on the Well.ca team helped me along with my development. It was so much fun working for a start up especially one that had an enthusiastic CEO and team. It was eye opening to learn about the start up community. The team made going to work not feel like work. It was more like hanging out with a couple of friends while doing some coding. Everyone was welcoming and talented. Special thanks to Milosz, who was my team lead and answered any questions I had about the code base or tools. He taught me a large number of things, that will come in handy in the future. Over the course of the 8 months I also made some mistakes but he always remained calm and led me to the correct solution. I'd also like to thank Diana and Patrick who were my other team mates on Well.ca. they answered any questions I had and also kept me having a fun time there.</p>
